==============================================

The Wanderer is a python web crawler designed to be a mulit-use web tool.

It will be expected to do the following:

+ Fetch HTML from a site or webpage

+ Fetch links from a webpage through HTML

+ Download video, image, and files from websites.

+ Index sites and write the data to a file.

The dependecies are currently unknown, but as development furthers, I will list them here.
